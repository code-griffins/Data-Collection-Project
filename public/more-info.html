    <p>
      The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU),
      the Linda Ugatuzi Civil Society, medics and a number of civil society
      organisations have asked the government to return management of the
      national health system from the County Government to the National
      Government. The County Governments lack enough resources to cater for the
      professionals, staff and support-staff in various hospitals across the
      county. 7 million signatures are required to ammend the constitution for
      the establishment of a Health Services Commission; which will provide a
      centralised mechanism for addressing issues affecting public health; such
      as the shortage of health professionals, drugs among others. Join the
      movement for a better change since devolution has weakened health care
      delivery in the country in the last 10 years of devolution.
